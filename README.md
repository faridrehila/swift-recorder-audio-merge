# swift-recorder-audio-merge

Record the first audio file by pressing the record button.

Then record a second audio file by pressing again on the record button. After stopping the second recording, the merge tracks function is called: the second audio file will be appended to the first audio file.

The problem is that the appending is taking too much time.
